Interview
=========

This is an app for conducting and recording interviews.

Interviews are structured using [FLP websites](https://github.com/nathanathan/FeelsLikePHP).

All the page transitions are logged making it possible to tell where in the recording a particular question is being answered.

The second half of this project will be a website that annotates the audio timeline with the page the interviewer is on,
and that makes it possible to search through recordings for responces to particular questions.

Technologies
------------

The app is currently being designed to run on mobile devices using Cordova.
The website for data exploration will probably be a couchapp.
