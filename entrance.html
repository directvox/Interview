<p style="max-width:500px;">
You are in hexagonal room surrounded by bookshelves on all sides.
In the center there is a ventilation shaft surrouned by a low railing.
There is a narrow hallway to your left, and behind you another from which you entered.
Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards into the remotest distances.
